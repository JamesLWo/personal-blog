<p>I like House Robber 2 because we do not have to do much to get the solution. It showcases a cool example of problem reduction - reducing a problem down to another problem. In problem reduction, if you have the solution too the equivalent problem, you also have the solution to the original problem! So the only challenge here is recognizing the problem is similar to one you have done before (in this case, itâ€™s House Robber 1!)</p>
